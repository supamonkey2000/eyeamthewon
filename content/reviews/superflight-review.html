<p>Imagine soaring with a wingsuit through endless, unique, beautiful worlds without a worry you might get hurt, despite traveling at intense speeds. <i>Superflight</i> allows you to do just this. It is an incredibly simple game with a single goal: Fly a wingsuit without crashing for as long as you can. If you crash, do it again. And again. <i>And again</i>. The only thing to lose is your score, which resets to zero on a crash (don't worry, your high scores always get saved). It's not a complex game, but that is what makes it so appealing.</p>
<p>Don't expect to collect coins, unlock upgrades, or reach a "hero's ending". In <i>Superflight</i>, all you do is fly through procedurally generated worlds with a wingsuit. Flying close to walls earns points, and risky decisions pay off in the form of bonus points. If you stray away from a wall, your points are added to your current score. Crashing, however, loses all your points. The only real goal is to achieve the best high score possible. There is no online leaderboard; the only indicator of your ranking is a small number beneath your score. Traversing between worlds is done in one of two ways: fly through a portal, which cashes in your points and gives a bonus of 1000; or "blackout" by flying beneath the world into the abyss. Both methods retain your current score. The controls are simple as well: WASD, Arrow Keys, or a gamepad. All work equally well, but a gamepad is recommended for slight adjustments mid-flight. Sounds simple? Totally. Fun? <b>Absolutely</b>.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the game is the best part of it. If you're bored, open up <i>Superflight</i> and fly around, trying new moves and smashing your high score. The game is very calming as well (once the wind volume is turned down). It's relaxing, which is hard to find in PC games these days. Because the worlds are generated at random, there is an infinite number of possible worlds to explore. A seed feature lets you "invent" your own worlds. Say you use your name as a seed, and you enjoy the world, any of your friends can play the same world with the same seed. You can also save worlds that you like if you want to return to them later. The art style is interesting, but in a good way. It gives personality to each world you visit</p>
<p>As it was developed by 3 students, there is not a huge amount of content due to restricted development time. They decided "procedurally generated" content was the best way to go about making the game. Their unique terrain generation system allows player to explore infinite worlds. This quick and efficient fix allowed the team to focus on innovative movement, and polishing for the best possible user experience.</p>
<p>Jumping into the game, you can instantly start flying away. If you have read this far, then you are already aware of the game's full featureset. Nearly every part of <i>Superflight</i> is just awesome. As said before, the simplicity is the best part. It is easy to play for hours on end without realising the time passing. The replayability is insane. I find a new adventure every time I open the game.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few (minor) faults. Lack of an online leaderboard doesn't let you see where you and your friends stack up against each other. There isn't a multiplayer option, but given the developer's situation, this makes lot's of sense. It can be difficult to host dedicated servers, and teleporting in multiplayer could cause issues. A gripe I had was that I wouldn't get bonuses where you might think you earn a bonus. But, you get over it pretty quickly. A console version of the game would be nice as well.</p>
<p>Overall, <i>Superflight</i> is an amazing, simple, fun game that comes at the price of a coffee. It may not be filled with features, but that is what makes it so good. There's no planning involved, just flying through an endless slew of unique worlds. I would highly recommend <i>Superflight</i>.</p>
