<h2 class="inline">Net Neutrality Repealed by FCC</h2><p class="inline"><i> - Thursday, December 14th 12:51pm</i></p>
<p>Today (December 14th), the FCC of the United States voted to repeal Net Neutrality. This vote will allow ISPs to introduce new restrictions on consumers, despite FCC chairman Ajit Pai advocating a "freer internet". Ajit, you couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p>Millions of comments were submitted to the FCC and Congress, and protests occured throughout the USA over the past few months. Still, Net Neutrality died. Hopefully ISPs don't introduce restrictions as that is the <i>complete opposite</i> of a "free internet". How could Ajit Pai and the FCC not see this?! Granted, there were a few FCC members who supported Net Neutrality.</p>
<p>What will the internet look like now? Will other countries follow in the footsteps of the United States of America? Only time will tell.</p>

<h2 class="inline">Company Name Generator</h2><p class="inline"><i> - Sunday, December 3rd 4:16pm</i></p>
<p>Recently, I worked on an AI to generate names for companies. I used <a href="https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow">char-rnn-tensorflow</a>, created by Sherjil Ozair which is based off of <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn">char-rnn</a>, created by Andrej Karpathy. The list of companies I used to train the AI was a Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_the_United_States">listing companies in the United States</a>. The program is now finished, and you can access it <a href="https://bustedsocket.com/companynamegenerator">here</a>.</p>
