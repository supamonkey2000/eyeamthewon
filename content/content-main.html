		<p><strong>Company Name Generator</strong><i> - Sunday, December 3rd 4:16pm</i></p>
		<p>Recently, I worked on an AI to generate names for companies. I used <a href="https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow">char-rnn-tensorflow</a>, created by Sherjil Ozair which is based off of <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn">char-rnn</a>, created by Andrej Karpathy. The list of companies I used to train the AI was a Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_the_United_States">listing companies in the United States</a>. The program is now finished, and you can access it <a href="https://bustedsocket.com/companynamegenerator">here</a>.</p>
