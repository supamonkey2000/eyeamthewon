<p><strong>Neural Network to create company names</strong><i> - Tuesday, December 12 3:26pm</i></p>
<p>Using the char-rnn neural network, I created an AI model that generates company names. Based off a Wikipedia list of companies in the US, this is my most successful AI experiment yet. Below you can see a list of the best, and worst, that it came up with. (If you want to try it out for yourself, click <a href="https://bustedsocket.com/companynamegenerator">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best it came up with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gale &amp; Company</li>
	<li>Xais Corporation</li>
	<li>Rystle House &amp; Company</li>
	<li>Bynwurg International</li>
	<li>UniGro Group</li>
	<li>CVA Inc.</li>
	<li>U.S. Semiconductor</li>
	<li>Trinity International</li>
	<li>Harry's Bakers</li>
	<li>Schwan Star &amp; Corporate</li>
	<li>Forfree Insurance Corporation</li>
	<li>Alliance Financial Space</li>
	<li>American Financial Group.</li>
	<li>Disch National Science Corporation</li>
	<li>Mimmy International</li>
	<li>Seakey, Inc.</li>
	<li>Newex</li>
	<li>Obinc Holdings Company</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not perfect, as shown by these ones:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Curidwa Eaglee</li>
	<li>Ruigsal Pektoral</li>
	<li>CitinanZiance Groupe</li>
	<li>Bring Mourcade</li>
	<li>Abbersplar</li>
	<li>Gene Commenturest, Inc.</li>
	<li>Firagat</li>
	<li>Eastex Phizh</li>
	<li>Wedezenslent</li>
	<li>Rotsheeear</li>
</ul>
<p>Some seem OK, but are quite strange:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Live Maplies</li>
	<li>Walt's Spectating Company</li>
	<li>Company Group</li>
	<li>Petroleum</li>
</ul>
<p>Neural Networks can be pretty useful. But we can also use them to have fun with so-called "computer creativity". With the dataset I used, it didn't have a large amount of information to learn from, so I think it did fairly well with it's creations. I also tried it with Canadian companies, but the French names confused it and produced gibberish.</p>
