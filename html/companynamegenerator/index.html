<h2>Company Name Generator</h2>
<a href="generate.php">Click here to generate a new company name!</a>
<p>The names generated by this program are completely made up by a neural network (so a computer "invented" them). Anything it produces is <b>completely and totally</b> out of my control. Also, <i>please</i> don't run it over and over again as it wreaks havoc on my server. Thanks, and enjoy.</p>
